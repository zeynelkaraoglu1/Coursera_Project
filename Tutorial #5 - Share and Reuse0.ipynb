    "# Tutorial #5 - Share and Reuse\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to Cognitive Class Labs. This notebook is the **fifth** in a series of \"getting started\" tutorials that is designed to introduce some basic concepts and help get you familiar with using the workbench.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook we introduce you to some workbench features designed to help you share and reuse notebooks.  Specifically, this tutorial covers:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Share workbench files using share links\n",
    "    * Share a file\n",
    "    * Copy a shared file\n",
    "    * Unshare a file\n",
    "1. Download workbench files\n",
    "    * Download a single file\n",
    "    * Download files by tag\n",
    "    * Download all files in your workbench\n",
    "    * Download notebook as...\n",
    "1. Importable notebooks\n",
    "    * Create an importable notebook\n",
    "    * Import a notebook\n",
    "    * Call notebook functions\n",
    "    * Inject notebook recipes\n",
    "\n",
    "## Prerequisites\n",
    "This notebook assumes that you have completed the previous tutorials in the getting started series.  Though not required, it is recommended that you download these tutorial notebooks from the [Welcome](/pages/welcome) page and complete them before proceeding.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Share Workbench Files Using Share Links\n",
    "You can share a file in your Cognitive Class Labs environment by creating a *share link* to the file.  A share link is a URL that you can share with other Cognitive Class Labs users to allow them to download the file directly from your workbench to theirs.  \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">**Note:** At this time, share links only work within Cognitive Class Labs.  Users cannot download your shared files from the public Internet.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Share a File\n",
    "To share a file in your workbench:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Expand the file details section below the file name and click the **Share** link.  Cognitive Class Labs will display a link icon next to the file name to indicate that the file has a share link. It will also add new links to **Unshare** and **Show** the share link itself.\n",
    "1. Click the **Show Link** link. The share link's URL will now be selectable and able to be copied to your clipboard.\n",
    "1. Send the share link to people you want to be able to access the file.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Copy a Shared File\n",
    "If an Cognitive Class Labs user provides you with a share link, you can use the link to copy the shared file from that user's workbench directly to your own workbench.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Paste the share link into the search box in the upper right of your Cognitive Class Labs and press Enter.\n",
    "1. Your Cognitive Class Labs will attempt to download the file to your workbench.\n",
    "1. On success, the file will show up in your workbench.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">**Note:** Attempting to copy a file using a share link may fail if the share link is stale.  This can happen if the file's owner has unshared or removed the file.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Unshare a File\n",
    "To stop sharing a file in your workbench:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Expand the file details section below the file name and click the \"Unshare\" link. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">**Note:** Cognitive Class Labs users will receive an error if they attempt to use a share link to a file that has been unshared or deleted.\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "## Download Workbench Files\n",
    "In **Tutorial #1 - Get Data**, you learned how to upload and import files into your workbench environment.  Cognitive Class Labs also allows you to download files from your workbench to your local machine.  This gives you the freedom to share the files however and with whomever you choose.  \n",
    "\n",
    "You can download any or all files in compressed archive format.  You can also download IPython notebooks in select file formats.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download Single File\n",
    "To download an individual file, expand the file's detail section by clicking the **>** icon located  to the left of the file name in a sidebar panel.  Click the \"Download\" link in this section.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download Multiple Files\n",
    "You can download multiple files in a single compressed archive file from a sidebar panel.  Once you create a sidebar panel (see **Tutorial #3 - Organize** for instructions on how to do this), click the dropdown menu icon next to the panel title and select \"Download All\" from the dropdown menu.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download All Notebooks\n",
    "You can download all IPython notebooks in a single compressed archive file from the *My Workbench* dropdown menu in the top navigation bar.  Select *My Workbench > Download All Notebooks*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download Everything\n",
    "You can download the entire contents of your workbench directory in a single compressed archive file from the *My Workbench* dropdown menu in the top navigation bar.  Select *My Workbench > Download Everything*.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Download Notebook as...\n",
    "The IPython Notebook *File* menu supports options for downloading the current notebook after converting them to the selected format, including the IPython Notebook format (\\*.ipynb), Python script (\\*.py), and HTML. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Importable Notebooks\n",
    "In previous tutorials, we loaded the winter olympic medals data set, and either aggregated or filtered the data to answer specific questions.  For example, in the **Tutorial #2 - Explore and Visualize** notebook, we calculated and plotted the total medals that Norway had been awarded at each olympic games.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What if, in this notebook, we wanted to create the same plot, either for Norway or any other country.  Do you remember the code snippets we used to create that plot, or at least perform the data munging necessary to do so?  Once we find the right notebook and code cells, we can easily copy and paste the code into this notebook, but Cognitive Class Labs was created to help reduce this accidental complexity.\n",
    "\n",
    "What if, instead, we could write the code once in a notebook, and reuse it in other notebooks?  In this section, that is exactly what we will show you how to do.   We're going to create an importable notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-warning\">**Warning:** Importable notebooks is an experimental feature in Cognitive Class Labs.  The implementation is subject to change as the IPython Notebook file format changes.</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "### Create Importable Notebook\n",
    "We are going to create an importable notebook that provides convenience functions to load our olympic medals data sets and calculate medal counts.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 1: Create a new notebook\n",
    "Click the *New Notebook* button in the upper right corner of the workbench navigation bar.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rename the notebook, \"olympic_medals.ipynb\".\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Step 2: Add `<api>` code cells\n",
    "The cell below contains modified code that we used in a prior notebook to count the number of medals that a country has been awarded in each olympic games.  The code cell begins with the line\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# <api>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "which indicates that the code within the cell should be exposed to notebooks that import it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Copy the contents of the cell below into a new **code** cell in the \"olympic_medals.ipynb\" notebook.\n"

    "#### Step 3: Create help content\n",
    "It's a good idea to include some text (and even sample code) that lets consumers of the importable notebook know how to use it.  You can do this by annotating cells with a comment line like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "# <help>\n",
