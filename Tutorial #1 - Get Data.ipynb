    "\n",
    "Notebook is a web-based environment for interactive computing.  Cognitive Class Labs Notebook is based on [Jupyter (IPython) Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) and enables you to write and execute Python, R, Scala code within a \"notebook\" in your web browser.  You enter code into an input cell, and when you run the cell, the notebook executes the code and prints any output to an output cell.  You can change the code in an input cell and re-run the cell as often as you like.  In this way, the notebook follows a [Read Evaluate Print Loop](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read–eval–print_loop) paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "But that's not all.  The notebook also supports rendering markup cells (like this one) inline, so you can embed text, [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), HTML, images, videos, and even interactive widgets, all within a notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flow of a notebook is top to bottom, and you can create as many cells as you desire.  The interactive nature and the ability to render text and media makes Notebook a powerful environment for working with data, performing analyses, and documenting results.\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-info\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">**Note:** Our Notebooks support Python, R, Scala and other languages. In these tutorials, we assume you have a basic familiarity with the [Python Programming Language](https://docs.python.org/3/)\n",

    "Before we get started, here is a tour of Cognitive Class Labs Notebook layout:\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Navigation Bar**: The navigation bar at the top of the workbench page contains links to the DSWB homepage as well as dropdown menus to allow you to do everything from downloading a complete Notebook environment to your own machine, downloadinng workbench files to submiting feedback to the DSWB team.\n",
    "* **Omni Box**: The box is located in the upper right, within the navigation bar. You can use it to search within notebooks in your workbook environment or to import files from publicly addressable URLs. The workbench can currently import notebooks (.ipynb) and plain text data files (.csv, .txt, ...) given a direct URL to the file. It also supports imports from [NBViewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/) given a URL to a notebook on that site.\n",
    "* **New Notebook Button**: Click the button in the top right corner to create a new notebook in your workbench. Select the language you plan to use in the notebook (e.g., Python, R, Scala).\n",
    "* **Primary View**:  The primary view is the center panel which renders your notebooks, displays static pages such as *Welcome* and *About*, and shows search results. \n",
    "* **Sidebar**:  The sidebar, located on the right side of the page, contains panels to help you organize your notebooks and data files.  You can collapse or expand the sidebar by clicking the toggle (**>**) button in the top right corner of the primary view.\n",
    "* **Sidebar Panels**: Sidebar panels are dynamic subpanels that are intended to help you organize your work.  There are a few panels that are always shown, and of course, you can create your own custom tag panels. They can be expanded or collapsed or moved to the top/bottom of the page. The first two are default panels. You will create the others throughout these tutorials.\n",
    "    * **Recent Notebooks**: Lists the most recently accessed notebooks.\n",
    "    * **Recent Data**: Lists the most recently accessed data files.  Currently, a data file is everything that is not a notebook (.ipynb).\n",
    "    * **Recently Active Notebooks**: Lists the most recently accessed notebooks with a running IPython kernel.\n",
    "    * **Custom Tag Panels**: Lists most recently accessed workbench files that have the given tag.\n",
    "* **Sidebar Panel Items**: Each item within a sidebar panel represents a file in the workbench environment.  Clicking on the arrow to the left of each item exposes a collapsible section below the item that contains additional details and actions you can take on the item. Hovering the mouse over any icon or link reveals more information. Clicking the arrow again hides the additional details.\n",
    "* **Table of Contents**: When a notebook is open, you can click the triangle-shaped toggle button at the bottom left corner of the notebook next to scrollbar to toggle a dynamically generated table of contents. The table links to every [Markdown heading](https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/) within the notebook."

    "## Where is my data? \n",
    "Notebooks can work with data in variety of data sources and fomats. Every workbench comes with a local data folder where data is stored and is available for you to use within your Notebooks. This data is stored as text files using one of the popular formats (e.g. CSV, JSON etc.). In this tutorial you will bring data from external sources in to this local folder by uploading a file from your computer and importing a file from a publicly accessible repository. You can also use OpenRefine to find and prepare data for analysis and upload the files to your workbench local data folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the data stored in the local data folder, your code can read data from remote data sources such as relational databases and big data repositories e.g. Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). Access to external data is covered in other tutorials. \n",
    "\n",
    "Very large data sets (gigabytes) are best stored and processed by big data systems such as Apache Spark, Hadoop and data warehouse systems like dashDB, DB2, Oracle, Redshift etc. Data Scientist Workbench Notebooks include Apache Spark so that you can build and test your code locally and submit it for execution to a remote Spark cluster.
