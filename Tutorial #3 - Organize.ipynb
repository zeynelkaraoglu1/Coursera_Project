    "### Recently Active Panel\n",
    "When you click on a the name of a notebook, Cognitive Class Labs opens the notebook in a new view.  A kernel process is started on the server and associated with the notebook.  This kernel process is what executes the code cells and stores objects in memory.  For as long as the kernel process is running, the notebook is said to be 'active' or 'running'.\n",
    "\n",
    "You can create a panel that shows the most recently accessed notebooks with active kernels.  Simply drag the 'Active' text for an active notebook onto the sidebar to create this panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Organize Files\n",
    "Cognitive Class Labs allows you to tag individual files within your workbench environment.  You can also create your own custom tag panels, which allows you to organize your files by tag. \n",

    "Files that have no tags display as \"untagged\".  You can create a panel that lists recently accessed \"untagged\" files.  Simply drag the \"untagged\" text and drop it somewhere within the sidebar, in the same way you would to create a custom tag panel.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Close Panels\n",
    "You can close custom panels using the drop-down menu in the panel's title bar.  Click on the menu icon located to the right of the panel title and select \"Close\" from panel's the drop-down menu.\n",
